                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Jonathan Kofman and I am a master's student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA studying Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing. With an undergraduate degree in Aerospace engineering, I believe I am the perfect blend of mechanical, electrical, and industrial engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>Major projects for me have been:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Working on the 22A and 23A models of the Rutger's Formula Racing car as the aerodynamics lead</li>
                        <li>Being in charge of CNC and CAM designs for heat sink and ablative engines for Northeastern Aerospace Liquid Rocket Team</li>
                        <li>Solo designing and building a 2 stage mountable coilgun with a robot dog for navigation</li>
                        <li>Multi-stage pressurized water rocket for senior design project with ambition to break world record</li>
                        <li>Studying and Passing FE Mechanical Engineering Exam</li>
                    </ul>

                                <p>While on the team I helped coordinate the aerodynamic design of the cars' many components using SolidWorks and ANSYS to perform lift and drag tests utilizing set parameters which included Angle of Attack, Velocity, Temperature, and Provided load. I also performed ANSYS CFD and FEA over the front/rear wing as well as the front/rear diffusers to create the optimal design with cornering and downforce being the main priorities. Once all design work was done, I generated a Bill of Materials for aerodynamic features including front/rear wing, front/rear diffuser, and side skirts. To create the different molds which were then carbon fiber wrapped, the team utilized injection molding techniques to fabricate different components such as prototype wings for front and rear of the car. To help the electrical teams, I helped integrate HV disconnects to the main accumulator to disrupt power in case of emergency, and additionally helped assemble the wiring harness connecting different sub-components of the car.</p>

                                <p>Scarlet Flight was my senior design project which I co-led alongside 6 other seniors. On the team I led propulsion analysis which included but wasn't limited to: creating a test stand to hold the rocket body in place to perform thrust testing, while also optimizing body and nozzle design using SolidWorks for optimal flow, which was simulated using ANSYS, and finding the optimal launch pressure to ensure no failure to rocket while optimizing the maximum altitude. My team and I Used SLA and FDM 3D printing methods to create lightweight but durable nosecones, fin holders, bulkheads, and electronic bay holders which were tested iteratively to manufacture them as quickly and cheaply as possible. Our goal was to break the unofficial world record (1300ft) for Class B multi-stage pressurized water rockets according to WRA2 which we were simulated to beat by 255 feet using MATLAB software. Unfortunately, due to not having enough time to pursue this feat, we instead walked away with a top flight of 700 feet.</p>
